# dfserver

dfserver is a distributed backend AI pipeline server. The initial purpose of this project was to build a self-hosted distributed GPU cluster to run the [stable diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) model, but it has a potential to expend to general AI models, or large-scale production service.

# Getting Start

### Server Prerequisites

- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [discord developer](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro#bots-and-apps) account and a discord bot token

### Worker Prerequisites

- A group of friends who have fancy GPUs ü§™
- [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
- [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and [models](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)

### Build the dfserver

Requirements:

- [Go 1.18 or newer](https://golang.org/dl/)

```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/huo-ju/dfserver.git"
$ cd dfserver
$ make linux-amd64 #or make linux-arm64
```

### dfserver Configuration

```bash
cp configs/config.toml.sample configs/config.toml
```

Edit the config.toml, setup the username/password/host address/port of the rabbitmq.

The default configuration was defined ONE task queue for stable diffusion ai worker (name is ai.sd14), ONE discord bot service, ONE process worker for discord(name is discord.server1)

### Run dfserver

```bash
./dist/linux_amd64/dfserver --confpath=./configs
```

### AI Worker Install 

Copy the `pyworker` dir to the GPU server, and install all diffusers dependencies(nvidia drivers, CUDA, pytorch, models etc...).

```bash
cd pyworker
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git
```

### AI Worker Configuration

```bash
cp configs/config.ini.sample configs/config.ini
```

Edit the config.ini, setup the username/password/host address/port of the rabbitmq.

### Run the ai worker
```bash
python tworker.py
```

### Useage

Add the discord bot to your disord server, and input your prompt.

For example:

`!dream Cute sticker design of a AI image generator robotic pipeline service, app icon, trending on appstore, trending on pixiv, hyper-detailed, sharp`


The ai task will be collected from user input by discord bot, and published to the rabbitmq, then the task will be fetched by ai worker (running on GPU servers). 

The result (generated images) will be published back to the rabbitmq, fetched by process worker (discord.server1), and sent back to the user.

Run the dfserver and aiworker on boot, please see the systemd scripts in `deployments`

# TODO

* [] Response error messages to users
* [‚úîÔ∏è] More AI workers, eg: upscale worker 
* [] Multi GPUs worker support
* [] Initial image
* [] Mask/Inpaint
